Hi!

I'm on a journey to transition my career from ITOps into SecOps.

My current certs:
```
me.
```
How best to contact me:
```
kb.
```

My GnuPG PGP key can be found below, & [here](https://github.com/roelds/roelds.github.io/raw/main/null). To mitigate against MITM attacks, please verify the fingerprint of my key before use. This can be done by looking on the back of my biz card. The front of my biz cards also have qr code of hash checksum, that matches comment in key. This website should not be trusted for key verification.
